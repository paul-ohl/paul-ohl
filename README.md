## What my school taught me

School 42 Paris is a great school, it taught me how to work independantly and communicate with my peers.

More specifically, it taught me:
- general coding principles ([libft](https://github.com/paul-ohl/libft))
- function pointers and va_args ([printf](https://github.com/paul-ohl/printf))
- network programming basics (netwhat)
- Docker and running a basic server (ft_server)
- Graphics programming ([cub3d](https://github.com/paul-ohl/cub3d) and [fract-ol](https://github.com/paul-ohl/fract-ol))
- Basic assembly programming ([libasm](https://github.com/paul-ohl/libasm))
- The inner workings of bash, reading from and writing to files, pipes and so much more ([minishell](https://github.com/paul-ohl/minishell))
- Kubernetes basics (ft_services)
- C++ and more generally OOP ([containers](https://github.com/paul-ohl/containers))
- Sorting algorithms and optimisation ([philosophers](https://github.com/paul-ohl/philosophers))
- Socket programming in C/C++ ([webserv](https://github.com/paul-ohl/webserv))

## What I taught myself

I spend a lot of my free time on personnal projects, which allows me to keep the programming fun and improve.

I play a bit of [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/), you can [check out my profile](https://www.codingame.com/profile/03584765ce60c2e6df029de3f3727fc36821145), or [my solutions]()

I learned C# in order to create [a video game](https://sweetiemetalhead.itch.io/shooter-in-the-dark) (you can try it out!).

I taught myself how to manage a server to host [my personnal website](https://paulohl.fr).
